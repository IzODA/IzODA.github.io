                        Anaconda Installation and Configuration
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        This process installs all of the components of a fully a functional Anaconda deployment.  There are
                        some key characteristics of the z/OS environment to be aware of:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All Anaconda components are 64-bit ASCII applications.</li>
                        <li>Since Anaconda is an ASCII environment running on a platform with a default EBCDIC code page,
                        file tagging is used extensively.  Be aware that newly created files in this environment must be
                        properly tagged for everything to run smoothly.</li>
                        <li>These instructions are for a system administrator running in a z/OS shell.  They are tailored for
                        a bash shell instance.  If you are using the default <em>tcsh</em> that comes with z/OS, substitute the
                        <em>setenv</em> command for <em>export</em>.</li>
                        <li>Proper WLM classification of Python workloads depends on how the tasks and processes associated
                        with the application are named.  By default, all such tasks will be associated with the name of the
                        invoking user.  However, this gives no indication to WLM that the given task is part of a Python workload.
                        See the environmental setup section below for an explanation about how to associate a job name
                        with the tasks of your Python application that WLM can recognize.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h1 class="ds-heading-2 ds-padding-top-2">
                        Prerequisites
                    </h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IzODA installs Anaconda from a local archive shipped as part of the SMP/E offering.  Because of this,
                        the install process requires room for the archive, plus about the same amount of space in the target file
                        system that contains the Anaconda home directory - usually <em>/usr/lpp/IBM/izoda/anaconda</em>.  Since
                        Anaconda ships with approximately 230 packages, a finished install consumes between 2.5 and 3 GB.
                        <p/>
                        <p>In addition to the space required during the IzODA install, it's important to remember that Anaconda keeps
                        all package versions that have been installed from the IzODA channel through the conda command.  This
                        allows previous versions of any installed package to be referenced in addition to the latest version.  Be
                        sure to give Anaconda enough room to operate.  The minimum space for an Anaconda installation is 6 GB, and
                        the recommended amount of space is 20 GB.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Python makes use of the <em>/dev/urandom</em> character special file to read pseudo-random values for use in a
                        variety of applications.  The <em>Integrated Cryptographic Service Facility (ICSF)</em> service of z/OS
                        must be started for /dev/urandom to function properly.  Failures will occur if ICSF is not active when
                        Anaconda is installed.
<pre><code class="language-bash">
  head -c40 /dev/urandom
  head: /dev/urandom: EDC5157I An internal error has occurred.
</code></pre></li>
                        <li>The pre-requisite level of bash is 4.2.53.  This is the version installed as the default during Anaconda
                        installation.  A 4.3.46 version of bash is also included as an Anaconda package that can be installed via
                        conda.  This is a functional version of the shell, but this is not officially supported with either Spark
                        or Anaconda.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h1 class="ds-heading-2 ds-padding-top-2">
                        Environmental Setup
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        This is the setup necessary for any user to run Python applications and make use of other Anaconda functions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Include this setup in your .bashrc profile to make file conversion and tagging transparent
                            to your Python application:</li>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
  export _CEE_RUNOPTS="FILETAG(AUTOCVT,AUTOTAG) POSIX(ON)"
  if [[ "x$_BPXK_AUTOCVT" == "x" ]]; then
    export _BPXK_AUTOCVT=ON
    exec $BASH "$@"
  fi
</code></pre>
                            <li>Add the Anaconda bin directory to your PATH in .bashrc:
<pre><code class="language-bash">
export ANACONDA_ROOT="/usr/lpp/IBM/izoda/anaconda"
export PATH=$ANACONDA_ROOT/bin:$PATH
</code></pre>
                            The Anaconda bin directory doesn't have to be first in your PATH, but if there are
                            other shells or versions of bash installed on the system, the Anaconda bin directory
                            has to preceed them in the PATH.  Note: substitute the actual
                            path to the Anaconda root from your environment when exporting ANACONDA_ROOT.</li>
                            <li>Most Python applications will use the Optimized Data Layer to access data sources
                            on z/OS and from remote servers.  These call to ODL through the <em>dsdbc</em> api.  Set up
                            your STEPLIB to include the load library for this interface in .bashrc:
<pre><code class="language-bash">
  export STEPLIB=hlq.SAZKLOAD:$STEPLIB
</code></pre>
                            where <em>hlq</em> is the high-level qualifier of the ODL (MDS) installation.</li>
                            <li>Grant users running Python applications READ permission to the BPX.JOBNAME facility
                            class profile so that they can assign jobnames to their workload.  Please see the
                            <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.1.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r1.bpxb200/bpxenv.htm" class="ds-text-blue-primary-2" style="color: #0a9577 !important">

                    <p>
                        There are several additional steps that a system administrator may wish to perform, depending
                        on the runtime configuration they intend to create.  Before running any of the following steps,
                        cd to the root directory of the of the Anaconda installation.  Note that all of the tools below
                        are in the bin directory under the Anaconda root directory.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
		        <li>A common method of installing service involves mounting the filesystem containing Anaconda at a different location from normal, and in read_write mode.  After installing service, the filesystem is re-mounted at is usual location, and may be in read-only mode.  If you use this method, you must run change-prefix to fix the pathnames that are imbedded in many of the scripts.  change-prefix takes two arguments, old-prefix and new-prefix.  For example:
<pre><code class="language-bash">
  change-prefix /service/usr/lpp/IBM/izoda/anaconda /usr/lpp/IBM/izoda/anaconda
</code></pre>
			Please note that change-prefix is not included in the GA release of IzODA, but is included in the first PTF.  You can download change-prefix <a href="https://izODA.github.io/anaconda/change-prefix.pax">here</a>, then upload it to your system (in binary mode), then cd to the Anaconda root directory and unpack it with "pax -r -f change-prefix.pax".
                        <li>Bash 4.2 requires shell scripts to be encoded in EBCDIC, even though all Python scripts
                        in Anaconda are ASCII, and are file tagged to indicate this.  The
                        <em>install_ensure_scripts_are_in_ebcdic</em> tool can be used to guarantee all shell scripts
                        in the Anaconda installation have the proper encoding.</li>
                        <li>A good practice is to install Anaconda read-only for all users except an owning
                        administrator.  You can use the <em>install_set_single_anaconda_admin</em> tool to set the
                        <em>group</em> and <em>other</em> permissions for All Anaconda parts to read-only.</li>
                        <li>If you wish to set up Anaconda to be managed by a group of administrators, use the
                        <em>install_set_shared_anaconda_admin</em> tool.  Run the command like this:
<pre><code class="language-bash">
  install_set_shared_anaconda_admin groupname
</code></pre>
                        where groupname is the name of the administrators group.</li>
                        <li>If you plan to run Python code in a server (as a daemon), you should run the
                        <em>install_set_program_control</em> tool.  For more information, refer to the
                        <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.1.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r1.bpxb200/progcontr.htm" class="ds-text-blue-primary-2" style="color: #0a9577 !important">
                        Defining programs in UNIX files to program control</a> section of the <em>z/OS Unix System Services Planning</em>
                        guide.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        There is one mandatory last step - run the <em>conda</em> command to pull all updates to the Anaconda
                        environment from the IzODA channel on the Anaconda cloud.
<pre><code class="language-bash">
  conda update
  conda install bash=4.2
</code></pre>
                        This step is necessary because updates are frequently made to the packages of the
                        Anaconda root environment.  The PID version of IzODA will usually be downlevel from
                        the version that exists in the IzODA Anaconda channel.  If you use Spark, you should
                        also run the <em>conda install</em> to restore the version of bash that has been tested
                        with Spark.

                        A successful Anaconda installation results in a root environment that includes all of the
                        packages shipped with IzODA.  The root environment can be activated with the Anaconda

                      Applying maintenance
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                      Anaconda takes a new approach to software maintenance. Rather than require all
                      users on a system to use the same version of a given tool, Anaconda allows each user
                      to select whatever version they wish to run, by controlling the content of their
                      <em>conda environment</em>. Users can create as many environments as they wish,
                      potentially using different versions of tools for different task.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This means that installing new versions of the tools and packages controlled by
                      conda <em>adds the new versions to the system without removing old versions</em>.
                      This allows users to transition to new versions on their own schedule.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      That said, the <em>default</em> environment (also known as the <em>root</em>
                      environment) is managed by the system administrator, and usually provides
                      the most recent versions of tools.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The preferred means of installing new code into the conda root environment
                      is by using the <tt>conda update</tt> command. This will obtain the latest
                      versions of packages and tools from a <em>channel</em>. IBM provides the
                      <a href="https://anaconda.org/izoda/repo?type=conda&label=main"
                         class="ds-text-blue-primary-2"
                         style="color: #0a9577 !important">IzODA channel on the Anaconda cloud</a>,
                      which will be updated regularly with new packages, and new versions of
                      existing packages. This channel is enabled by default when Anaconda is
                      first installed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      However, not all installations will choose to install maintenance via the
                      Internet. For such installations, IBM will provide regular PTFs for use with
                      SMP/E.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Note, however, that installing maintenance via PTF will disable
                      default access to the IzODA channel, under the presumption that
                      subsequent maintenance will also be applied via SMP/E. Access can
                      be restored by

                      Maintaining the correct file ownership
                    </h1>

                    <p>
                      If Anaconda is installed and maintained by a userid other than <tt>root</tt>,
                      installation of maintenance will generally result in files in the
                      Anaconda root directory having the owner and group IDs of that userid.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       If, on the other hand, Anaconda is installed and maintained by <tt>root</tt>,
                       files created or modified by installing maintenance (either via <tt>conda update</tt>
                       or SMP/E) may produce files whose user and owner IDs are determined by
                       the system that created the package. This is not desirable. To avoid this
                       situation, execute the following commands, as <tt>root</tt> after installing maintenance:
                    </p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
  cd /usr/lpp/IBM/izoda/anaconda   # or the Anaconda root directory, if changed
  chown -R 0:0 .
</code></pre>

                    <p>
                      This will force the uid/gid for all of the files in the entire
                      Anaconda root directory (and subdirectories) to 0, which is reserved
                      for <tt>root</tt>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       The term "root" has one of three meanings, in the context of Anaconda:
                       <ul>
                         <li>
                           <tt>root</tt> can mean the <em>root userid</em>.  This user has uid 0.
                           However, in z/OS, there are other ways to get all privileges,
                           and the use of uid of 0 is less common.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                           <tt>root</tt> can mean the <em>Anaconda root directory</em>.
                           This is usually <tt>/usr/lpp/IBM/izoda/anaconda</tt>. It can be
                           changed at installation time, and will often be temporarily
                           different while service is being applied.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                           <tt>root</tt> can mean the <em>root conda environment</em>. When you run
                           the script named <tt>activate</tt> to activate a conda environment, it sets an
                           environment variable that causes bash to print the environment name in
                           parenthesis.  The default environment is named <tt>root</tt>.
                         </li>
                       </ul>

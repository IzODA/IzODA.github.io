# Welcome to IzODA's Documentation and Guides

Sections are organized by components (Apache Spark, Optimized Data Layer/MDS, Anaconda, and Ecosystem). Documentation, Guides, and Demos can be found within their corresponding sections. Thank you for using IBM Open Data Analytics on z/OS.

## End of Marketing and Migration  

The IBM Open Data Analytics for z/OS (IzODA) product has reached End of Marketing as of March 7, 2023, so customers must migrate to the replacement offerings.  In the navigation bar on the left, migration instructions for each component are given, as well as an overview on how to obtain the replacement products, including an updated version of the Bash shell.

Note that _End of Service_ is planned for February 29, 2024, so all migration should be completed by that time.

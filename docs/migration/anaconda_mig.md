# Anaconda

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is an assembly of parts that implement a Python-based analytics stack. It consists of multiple components:

- Python 3.7.0 / Python 3.6.1
- The conda package manager
- A library of locally installed open source packages
- A [channel, or reference repository](https://anaconda.org/IzODA/repo) located on the [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/)

## New Product

#Jupyter Notebook Usage

When using Jupyter Notebook on Z/OS you should generate a config file with the command

`jupyter â€“generate-config`

This will create a notebook config file in <em>~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py.</em>

If you want a basic Jupyter Notebook config file you can start with this

```
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
c.NotebookApp.ip = '<IP>'
c.NotebookApp.port = <Port>
```

If you would like to use Jupyter Notebook with Z/OS authentication you should have a config file that looks like the one below. One more step is required to enable Z/OS authentication. You will need to navigate to your anaconda root directory and run

`install_set_program_control`.

```
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
c.NotebookApp.ip = '<IP>'
c.NotebookApp.port = <Port>
c.NotebookApp.username = '<z/OS User ID>
```
